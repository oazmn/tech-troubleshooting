# The Tech Fix Log: Tools, AI & Workflows 🛠️

Welcome to my personal knowledge base! This repository is a collection of guides and solutions for technical hurdles I’ve encountered while using modern digital tools.

## 📖 About This Repository
Modern tech is powerful but often frustratingly complex. This repository bridges the gap between encountering a "silent" error and finding a plain-English solution. Whether it's an AI integration failing or a software setting gone wrong, you'll find my "lessons learned" here.

## 🚀 What I'm Documenting
I focus on the tools that help us work smarter, not harder:
- **AI Productivity** (Gemini, Claude, Automation)
- **App Integrations** (Connecting tools that don't want to talk to each other)
- **Workflow Optimization** (Making tech work for me, not the other way around)
- **Platform Troubleshooting** (GitHub, Google Workspace, etc.)

## 🤝 Sharing is Caring
If you found a solution here that helped you—awesome! I believe tech should be accessible to everyone, not hidden away. If you have a simpler way to explain something, feel free to reach out.
